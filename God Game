#You are God. 
##you are sitting around in heaven. 
##drinking beer and playing the God Game. 
###you are manipulating 26 levers simultaneously.
###the many dimensons of the Universe are being woven on a loom. 
###the noise is deafening. 
###God is manipulating tornados, hurricanes, tidal waves and volcanos. 
###the object of the game is to kill as many people as possible. 
###every once in a while a poor sucker is seen floating
###on the meniscus of the event horizon of a black hole. 
###dovening, and begging G*D for mercy. 
###THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO AVOID THE PRAYERS OF THE HUMANS
AND KEEP having fun.
